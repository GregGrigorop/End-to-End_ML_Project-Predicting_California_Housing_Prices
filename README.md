# Predicting_Housing_Prices

This repo presents an **End-to-End Regression Machine Learning project** for predicting housing prices in California. It is my own implementation of a project from the book 
"Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow" and the goal was to build a housing prices model for California using census data of the state. This 
solution could form the backbone for other similar modelling challenges as well.

The main steps of the project are:
1. Providing the context
2. Getting the data
3. Exploring/Visualising data
4. Preparing the data for Machine Learning algorithms
5. Exploring/Training various models and shortlisting the most promising ones
6. Fine-tuning our models (hyperparameter search)

If this were a real business challenge we would also _present our solution_ after the aforementioned steps and then *launch/productionise our system*.
